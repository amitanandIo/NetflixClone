# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project Description
Project: Netflix clone

Project: Netflix clone

Aim: At that time I was wondering how these big giants might have created their websites, millions of users are visiting their sites daily. So I made this project to check my abilities and whether I am able to replicate them.

Component Interaction: I have used HTML, CSS, and React for the frontend part all of these are interacting with virtual DOM(Document Object Model) and for hosting and the Backend part I have used a little bit of Node as an NPM.

Tech Used: I have made a project named Netflix clone using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Firebase, And Node.js.

Specific Role: I have done this project individually but I have my friend to interact and solve my technical doubt so this is not that I haven't worked in a team, All of us worked like a team and interacted with each other for our personal projects.

Long-term goal: I have used a YouTube trailer button in my project on which if the user will click then he/she can watch the trailer of that movie on YouTube so we can see all the movies on a single free platform which is completely free. I am proud to say that my college friends also use this website when they are going to watch movies.

Scope: As we know that there is always a scope for improvement so I can use some new features I want to make a Discussion type of platform where users can discuss the movie.
